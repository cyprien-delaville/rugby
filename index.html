			<h2>1. Principal rules</h2>
				<h3>In-play conduct and Possession rules</h3>
					<p>
						<b>Passes :</b> Players can pass the ball laterally or backwards; forward passes are illegal and result in a scrum.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Tackles :</b> Players can tackle only the ball carrier, targeting below the shoulders and using arms. Tackles above the shoulders are considered high and are penalized.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Releases :</b> Tacklers must release the tackled player and ball immediately to allow fair competition for possession.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Offside :</b> Players must remain behind the ball carrier or the hindmost foot in rucks and mauls.
					</p>


				<h3>Scoring system</h3>
					<p>
						<b>Try :</b> Worth 5 points, scored by grounding the ball in the opponent’s in-goal area.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Conversion :</b> After a try, a team attempts a place kick for 2 additional points.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Penalty Kick :</b> Worth 3 points, awarded for certain infringements by the opposition.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Drop Goal :</b> Worth 3 points, scored during open play by drop-kicking the ball through the opponent’s goalposts.
					</p>
				<h3>Sanctions</h3>
					<p>
						<b>Advantage Rule :</b> When a team commits an infringement, the non-offending team may play on if they have an opportunity to gain ground or a favorable position. If no advantage is gained, play returns to the original infringement.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Scrum :</b> When there is a forward pass, or when there is a fault, the team receiving the foul can choose the scrum.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Penalty Kick :</b> Worth 3 points, awarded for certain infringements by the opposition.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Free Kick :</b> For serious infringements like high tackles, offside offenses, not releasing the ball after a tackle, or foul play, the non-offending team is awarded a penalty kick, with the option to kick for goal (attempting to score 3 points), touch (kicking to the sideline for a lineout closer to the try line), or tap (taking a quick restart to continue open play).
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Yellow card :</b> For repeated or moderately dangerous offenses, such as repeated infringements, deliberate knock-ons, or high tackles, the player is temporarily suspended for 10 minutes, leaving their team with 14 players on the field.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Red card :</b> For serious foul play, including dangerous tackles, intentional striking, kicking, or any dangerous, violent, or repeated high infractions, the player is permanently expelled from the game, and their team plays with 14 players for the remainder of the match. In some competitions, a replacement may be allowed after 20 minutes, depending on specific league rules.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Penalty try :</b> If a team commits a foul that prevents a probable try from being scored, a try worth 7 points (no conversion kick needed) is automatically awarded to the attacking team.
